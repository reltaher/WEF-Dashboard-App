# Water Energy Food System Dashboard Application

This project is a sensor-based visualization platform for the Water-Energy-Food System at Florida Gulf Coast University's Emergent Technology Institute located on Alico Road. The overall goal of this project is to optimize the production and quality of biogas from food waste. To achieve this goal, we needed to develop a correlation between temperature and biogas production and composition, and to develop a correlation between pH and biogas production and composition. In order to accomplish these objectives, we had to track data collected from these sensors in real-time and display a visualization of it on a software platform, which is what this application is doing exactly. The system contains sensors used to collect real-time data that includes biogas volume, biogas composition, pH, biogas tempaerature, and outside temperature.

## Demonstration

Our team made a video demonstrating information about the project, and it includes a demonstration of the platform itself. Here is the link to the video:

## Documentation

Documentation will soon be added to this project using JSDocs.

## Diagrams
